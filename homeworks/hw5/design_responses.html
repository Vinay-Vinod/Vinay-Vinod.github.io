                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned how flexbox can be used for certain design requirements. It always everything to be smooth and can allow clean animations. This overall makes the experience better for the user. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of the article was looking at all the different designs. From the Nike App to crypto, each one had its one unique feel. This makes me more motivated to master the art of flexbox.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite design so far was the cryptocurrency one. First of all the color scheme with purple and black is something I really like, and overall makes the design clean. But my most favorite is the animation when you are sending crypto to someone else. The little circle and dots both serve a functional purpose of telling the user how much they are sending, but at the same time gives a cool look to it. </p>
