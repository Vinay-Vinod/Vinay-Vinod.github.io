            <li>I learned for design it's better to study existing apps. From there you can borrow features or create new ones based on what you want to improve</li>
            <li>I liked the part where they went over each app design. I especially liked the Spotify one</li>
            <li>You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product.</li>
