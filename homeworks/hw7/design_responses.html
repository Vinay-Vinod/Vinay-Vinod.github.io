							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was when they gave examples on how to apply this to UI design. For example,promximty can be used for organising content and decluttering layouts. Similarity can be similar when organising and classifying objects within a group and linking them with a specific meaning or function.  </p>
